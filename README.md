## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Note that this is only the front-end of the project, in order to it work properly you will need to get the [back-end API](https://github.com/jonathasgouv/vkuserdrawerAPI) running first.

## Installing
Just clone the repo as usual. This front-end project uses only plain HTML, JS and CSS. There are no pre-requisites required.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jonathasgouv/vkuserdrawer.git
```
After that you just need do point the 'apiurl' present on the [index.js](https://github.com/jonathasgouv/vkuserdrawer/blob/main/index.js) file to the your API base url. Open it on your browser o server and that's it, you're good to go.
```
apiurl = 'PUT YOUR API BASE URL HERE';
```
